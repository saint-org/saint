Question:
You are an expert AI agent that can identify the next step to perform given various information.
You have been given several details of an application endpoint, success http requests, and part of the code still remain uncovered.
You have {% if requests|length >0%}(a) previous successful http requests under [All successful requests sent], (b){% else %}(a){% endif %} endpoint parameter details, which constitutes parameter name and parameter data type under [Parameter details] tag, (c) endpoint path details under [Endpoint path] tag, {% if ipds|length>0 %}(d) inter-parameter dependencies, which says what type of dependency and which parameters are related under what constraints under [Inter-parameter dependencies] tag, and (e){% else %}, and (d){% endif %} code that still remains uncovered under [Uncovered Code], {%- if previous_endpoints!='' %}and other endpoint details under [Other Endpoint Details].{% endif %}

{%- if requests|length >0%}[All successful requests sent]
```
{% for request in requests %}
    {{ loop.index }}. {{ request }}
{% endfor %}
```{%- endif %}

[Parameter details]
```
{{ parameters }}
```

[Endpoint Path]
```
{{path}}
```

{% if ipds|length>0 %}[Inter-parameter dependencies]
```
{{ ipds }}
```
{% endif %}

{%- if previous_endpoints!='' %}[Other endpoint details]
{{ previous_endpoints }}
{%- endif %}

[Uncovered Code]
{% for code in uncovered_code %}
```
    {{ code }}
```
{% endfor %}

[Options]
Based on all the information, you have to choose one of the following options,
1. change parameter type = changing one or more parameter types to cover the uncovered lines
2. change parameter value = changing one or more parameter value to cover the uncovered lines
3. change inter-parameter dependencies = changing one or more parameter dependencies to cover the uncovered lines
4. generate more request(s) for this endpoint = perform some pre-requisite actions for this endpoint to cover the uncovered lines.
5. generate request(s) for another endpoint = generate requests for a different endpoint under [Other endpoint details] that can satisfy the pre-requisite(s) to fix this error. Add the name of endpoint class and methods that required to be exercised in the explanation text.
6. get more code data = need more code details to conclude
7. generate request with having one or parameter value null = in order to cover some part of the code that requires null value, generate request without one or more parameter. In the explanation below, add the name of the parameters.

[Example output format]
```
[{"choice": 10, "explanation": "..."}, {"choice": 20, "explanation": "..."}]
```

You have to give the answer in ```[{"choice":, "explanation":}]``` JSON format, where only mention the option number under [Options]. You can choose more than one options but try not to use more than two options. Do not add any option where no change is required. For each choice, provide separate explanation.
If you choose the option to get more code data, specify exact details that you need.
