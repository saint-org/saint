Question:
You are an expert to add inter parameter dependencies to increase the coverage of the uncovered code. You have been given the following information,
1. code with uncovered lines with [{{uncovered_line_marker}}] marking under [Uncovered code] block
2. available groups and their definition under [Available groups]
3. existing inter-parameter dependency under [Erroneous grouped parameters].
{% if additional_context!='' %}4. additional context under [Additional context]{% endif %}

Your task is to look at all the information and add the inter-parameter dependencies and add inter-parameter dependencies in the same format as in [Existing grouped parameters] so that it can cover the uncovered lines. Ensure your response is a valid list of dictionaries and do not repeat the example.

[Available groups]
Below, the definition of each group. Use this definition and identify constraints if there is any.
```
Requires: The Requires dependency is the simplest pattern. If a parameter is used (or it has a certain value), then another parameter must be used too (or be set to a certain value).
Or: Out of two or more parameters, at least one must be used.
OnlyOne: Out of two or more parameters, one, and only one of them must be used.
AllOrNone: Out of two or more parameters, either all of them are used, or none of them.
ZeroOrOne: Out of two or more parameters, either zero or one can be used, but not more.
Arithmetic: Two or more parameters are related by means of arithmetic (+, –, ×, ÷) or relational (<, ≤, >, ≥, =, ≠) operators. The most common shape of this dependency pattern is two parameters where one must be greater than or equal to the other, i.e., p1 ≥ p2.
```
[Example]
```
public void foo(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {
    String a = req.getParameter("a");
    if (a=="bar")
    {
        String b = req.getParameter("b");
        String c = req.getParameter("c");
    }
}
Output: [
{"relation_type":"Requires", "parameters": ["a", "b", "c"], "constraint":["a==bar"]},
]
```

[Grouped parameters]
```
[
{"relation_type":"Requires", "parameters": [], "constraint":[]},
]
```

[Uncovered Code]
{% for code in uncovered_code %}
```
    {{ code }}
```
{% endfor %}

{% if additional_context!='' %}
[Additional context]
{{ additional_context }}
{% endif %}

[Existing grouped parameters]
```
{{ existing_ipd }}
```
